        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Waffles are delicious breakfast or dessert treats loved by many. 
            They are made from a batter consisting of flour, eggs, milk, and butter, 
            which is cooked in a waffle iron until golden and crispy on the outside. 
            The result is a delightful combination of fluffy texture on the inside and a slightly crispy exterior. 
            Waffles can be enjoyed plain, but they are often topped with a variety of tasty additions such as syrup, 
            powdered sugar, fresh fruits, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, or even savory options like fried chicken or bacon. 
            Whether enjoyed as a traditional breakfast or a delightful indulgence, yummy waffles are a beloved treat that satisfies both the taste buds and the soul.
